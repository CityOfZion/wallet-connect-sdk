# Usage Guide

Before continuing, make sure you followed the [Installation and Setup](README.md#installation-and-setup).

## Check if the user is connected
Before doing anything, you should check if the user is connected, to do so, use the `isConnected` method:
```js
if (wcSdk.isConnected()) {
  console.log(wcSdk.getAccountAddress()) // print the first connected account address
  console.log(wcSdk.getChainId()) // print the first connected account chain info
  console.log(wcSdk.session.namespaces); // print the blockchain dictionary with methods, accounts and events
  console.log(wcSdk.session.peer.metadata); // print the wallet metadata
}
```

## Connect to the Wallet

Start the process of establishing a new connection to be used when there is no `wcSdk.session`. You'll need to specify which methods you want to authorize:

```js
if (!wcSdk.isConnected()) {
  // choose between neo3:mainnet, neo3:testnet or neo3:private, and the methods you want to use
  await wcSdk.connect('neo3:testnet', ['invokeFunction', 'testInvoke', 'signMessage', 'verifyMessage'])
  // add all WcSdk method names you are using

  // and check if there is a connection
  console.log(wcSdk.isConnected() ? 'Connected successfully' : 'Connection refused')
}
```

The `connect` method will open a new browser tab to help the user to connect with its wallet and save the session state,
but instead, you can use `createConnection` to choose a different behavior, like opening a modal and doing something
different with the session.

```ts
const { uri, approval } = await wcSdk.createConnection('neo3:testnet', ['invokeFunction', 'testInvoke', 'signMessage', 'verifyMessage'])
window.open(`https://neon.coz.io/connect?uri=${uri}`, '_blank')?.focus() // do whatever you want with the uri
const session = await approval()
wcSdk.setSession(session)
console.log(session ? 'Connected successfully' : 'Connection refused')
```

## Disconnect

It's interesting to have a button to allow the user to disconnect its wallet, call `disconnect` when this happens:

```js
await wcSdk.disconnect();
```

## Invoking a SmartContract method on NEO 3 Blockchain

To invoke a SmartContract method you can use `invokeFunction` method.

Neo blockchain expect arguments with `{ type, value }` format, check the [NeonDappkit's Arguments Documentation](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-dappkit/blob/main/packages/neon-dappkit/ARGUMENTS.md) to understand how to format them.

To invoke a SmartContract, it's important to know the argument types of the method, this information can be found on the contract page on Dora.
On the example below we are invoking the `transfer` method of the [GAS](https://dora.coz.io/contract/neo3/mainnet/0xd2a4cff31913016155e38e474a2c06d08be276cf) token.

Check it out:

```ts
const resp = await wcSdk.invokeFunction({
    invocations: [{
        scriptHash: '0xd2a4cff31913016155e38e474a2c06d08be276cf', // GAS token
        operation: 'transfer',
        args: [
            { type: 'Address', value: wcSdk.getAccountAddress() ?? '' },
            { type: 'Address', value: 'NbnjKGMBJzJ6j5PHeYhjJDaQ5Vy5UYu4Fv' },
            { type: 'Integer', value: 100000000 },
            { type: 'Array', value: [] }
        ]
    }],
    signers: [{
        scopes: 'CalledByEntry'
    }]
})
```

Options for each `invocation`:

- `scriptHash`: the SmartContract ScriptHash
- `operation`: the SmartContract's method name
- `args`: the parameters to be sent to the method, as explained above
- `abortOnFail`: when requesting multiple invocations, you can set `abortOnFail` to true on some invocations so the VM will abort the rest of the calls if this invocation returns `false`

Options for each `signer`:

- `scopes`: to specify which scopes should be used to sign the transaction, [learn more](https://developers.neo.org/docs/n3/foundation/Transactions#scopes). This property accepts them as a string as seen on the examples, or as a number, which can be imported from `WitnessScope` of `neon-js`.
- `account`: to specify which account's or contract's scripthash should be used to sign the transaction, otherwise the wallet will use the user's selected account to sign. If the value starts with "0x", then it will be trimmed to use the rest of the hexstring. It does not accept addresses, only scripthashes. If you need to sign as a contract, then you can use its scripthash, but beware: internally this contract's [`verify`](https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/77feb5639ad22d09363aacebd4fb8e1880f3cb29/nep-22.mediawiki#verify) method will be called and it needs to return `true`, otherwise this signature will be invalid and the transaction will fail.
- `allowedContracts`: when the `scopes` property is set as `CustomContracts`, you should use this property to specify a list with the script hash of the contracts that are allowed.
- `allowedGroups`: when the `scopes` property is set as `CustomGroups`, you should use this property to specify the public key of the groups that are allowed.
- `rules`: are needed when you have a complex scope and need to use logic to allow or deny which smart contracts have access to the signature. [Learn more](https://developers.neo.org/docs/n3/foundation/Transactions#witnessrule).

Additional root options:

- `systemFeeOverride`: to choose a specific amount as system fee OR `extraSystemFee` if you simply want to add more value to the minimum system fee.
- `networkFeeOverride`: to choose a specific amount as network fee OR `extraNetworkFee` if you simply want to add more value to the minimum network fee.

Here is a more advanced example:

```ts
const resp = await wcSdk.invokeFunction({
    invocations: [{
        // ...
        abortOnFail: true // if this invocation returns false, the VM will abort the rest of the calls
    },
    {
        // ...
    }],
    signers: [{
        scopes: 'Global',
        account: '857a247939db5c7cd3a7bb14791280c09e824bea', // signer account scripthash
    }],
    extraSystemFee: 1000000, // minimum system fee + 1 GAS
    networkFeeOverride: 3000000 // sending 3 GAS instead of the minimum network fee
})
```

                }
            }
        ]
    }],
})
```
</details>

### Calling TestInvoke

To retrieve information from a SmartContract without spending GAS, and without persisting any information on the blockchain, you can use `testInvoke` method.

On the example below we are invoking the `balanceOf` method of the `GAS` token.

Check it out:

```ts
const resp = await wcSdk.testInvoke({
    invocations: [{
        scriptHash: '0xd2a4cff31913016155e38e474a2c06d08be276cf', // GAS token
        operation: 'balanceOf',
        args: [
            { type: 'Address', value: wcSdk.getAccountAddress() ?? '' }
        ]
    }],
    signers: [{
        scopes: 'Global'
    }]
})

```

### Traverse iterator

The traverseIterator method allows you to traverse an iterator returned by a SmartContract method.

On the following example we are getting all the candidates from the
[NEO token](https://dora.coz.io/contract/neo3/mainnet/ef4073a0f2b305a38ec4050e4d3d28bc40ea63f5) and then traversing the
iterator to get the first 10 items.

```ts
const resp = await wcSdk.testInvoke({
    invocations: [
        {
            operation: "getAllCandidates",
            scriptHash: "ef4073a0f2b305a38ec4050e4d3d28bc40ea63f5", // neo token
            args: [],
        },
    ],
    signers: [{ scopes: "CalledByEntry" }],
});

const sessionId = resp.session as string;
const iteratorId = resp.stack[0].id as string;

const resp2 = await wcSdk.traverseIterator(sessionId, iteratorId, 10)
```

### Calculate Fee

It's important to know how much a transaction will cost before invoking.

The `calculateFee` function facilitates this by allowing users to input the same arguments they would use in the
`invokeFunction`. This process yields detailed information about the `networkFee`, `systemFee`, and the aggregate `total`.

See the example below:

```ts
const resp = await wcSdk.calculateFee({
    invocations: [{
        scriptHash: '0xd2a4cff31913016155e38e474a2c06d08be276cf',
        operation: 'transfer',
        args: [
            { type: 'Address', value: wcSdk.getAccountAddress() ?? '' },
            { type: 'Hash160', value: 'NbnjKGMBJzJ6j5PHeYhjJDaQ5Vy5UYu4Fv' },
            { type: 'Integer', value: '100000000' },
            { type: 'Array', value: [] },
        ],
    }],
    signers: [{ scopes: 'CalledByEntry' }],
})

console.log(resp) // will print an object with `networkFee`, `systemFee` and `total`
```

### Sign and Verify message
The process of signing and then verifying a message is useful to prove that the user owns a specific account and have
truly signed your specific message. 
```ts
// 1) sign a message
const mySignedMessage = await wcSdk.signMessage({ message: 'My message', version: 2 })
// the signed message contains messageHex, data, publicKey and salt

// 2) store or share these information to be verified later or by someone else

// 3) check if the signature is valid, if the method returns true, it is certain that that specific publicKey signed that messageHex
const valid = await wcSdk.verifyMessage(mySignedMessage)
```
You can use different **versions**, the default is `2`, but you can use `3` to sign a message without salt, and `1` to
use the legacy version.

### Encrypt and Decrypt data

```ts
// 1) encrypt data using the public key of the recipient, so only the recipient can decrypt it with his private key
// this method receives an array of public keys, so you can encrypt the data for multiple recipients
// and it returns an array of encrypted messages, one for each recipient public key
const encryptedMessages = wcSdk.encrypt("Data to be encrypted", [recipientPublicKey])

// 2) select which encrypted message you want to use
const encryptedMessage = encryptedMessages[0]

// 3) on the other side, the recipient can decrypt the data using his private key
const messageDecrypted = wcSdk.decrypt(encryptedMessage)
```
On the example above, we used the `decrypt` with a single encrypted message, which is faster, but you can use
`decryptFromArray` to pass multiple encrypted messages, and the recipient will try to decrypt until it finds the correct
one.
```ts
// 1) encrypt data using the public key of many recipients
const encryptedMessages = wcSdk.encrypt("Data to be encrypted", [
    jackPublicKey, rickPublicKey, bobPublicKey
])

// 2) on the other side, one of the recipients can decrypt the data using his private key
const messageDecrypted = wcSdk.decryptFromArray(encryptedMessages)
```
This method is slower than the `decrypt` method, so you should use it only if you are not sure which encrypted message
is the correct one.

## Get Wallet Info

To get information about the wallet, such as if it is a Ledger wallet, you can use the `getWalletInfo` method.

On the following example we are getting the wallet info, which is returning `false` because it is not a Ledger wallet.

```ts
const walletInfo = await wcSdk.getWalletInfo()
console.log(walletInfo) // { isLedger: false }
```

## Get Network Version

To get the network version, you can use the `getNetworkVersion` method.

On the following example we are getting the network version.

```ts
const networkVersion = await wcSdk.getNetworkVersion()
```

It will return an object like this:

```json
{
  "rpcAddress": "https://mainnet2.neo.coz.io:443",
  "tcpport": 10333,
  "wsport": 10334,
  "nonce": 1708007624,
  "useragent": "/Neo:3.5.0/",
  "protocol": {
    "addressversion": 53,
    "network": 860833102,
    "validatorscount": 7,
    "msperblock": 15000,
    "maxtraceableblocks": 2102400,
    "maxvaliduntilblockincrement": 5760,
    "maxtransactionsperblock": 512,
    "memorypoolmaxtransactions": 50000,
    "initialgasdistribution": 5200000000000000
  }
}
```
